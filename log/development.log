Il vit seul dans une petite maison très sympathique à 1h de route au nord d’Auckland où il travaille dans un atelier pour bateaux depuis maintenant 20 ans. Il m’explique tout un tas de truc sur son boulot qui le passionne. Il a lui même un bateau qu’il utilise régulièrement le week-end pour aller pêcher. Il s’est séparé de sa femme avec qui il a deux enfants.  Il a voyagé aux Etats Unis et en Europe il y a une quinzaine d’année et considère qu’il doit redonner tout ce que les gens ont pu lui donner au cours de ces voyages. Cela donne des idées.
